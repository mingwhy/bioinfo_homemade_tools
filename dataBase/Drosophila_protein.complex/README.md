I downloaded data from this publication: 2011, [A Protein Complex Network of Drosophila melanogaster](https://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0092-8674%2811%2901080-4)

In the abstract:
>Stringent analysis of these data, based on a statistical framework designed to define individual protein-protein interactions, led to the generation of a Drosophila protein interaction map (DPiM) encompassing 556 protein complexes. 

So, they reported 556 protein complexes.

I downloaded [Table S4](https://www.cell.com/cms/10.1016/j.cell.2011.08.047/attachment/22414ceb-7ffc-48e6-bfb8-58be7a929432/mmc4.zip) from https://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0092-8674%2811%2901080-4#supplementaryMaterial

>**Table S4. MCL-Derived 556 Putative Drosophila Protein Complexes in DPiM, Related to Figure 2**
>A total of 153 protein clusters are enriched for features such as GO terms, KEGG pathways or Pfam/InterPro domains (multiple hypothesis testing -adjusted p < 0.01). Enriched terms for each cluster along with p values are shown; (Microsoft Excel file) related to Figure 2 of the main text.
