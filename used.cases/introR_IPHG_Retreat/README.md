I made a series of slides on the introduction to R & Rstudio via R pacakge `Quarto`.

The script generating the html file is: **introR_ming_20220919.qmd**

My customerized scss file is: **ming_custom.scss**

Have a look at the **introR_ming_20220919.html** or on [my blog](https://mingwhy.github.io//talks/). 

Enjoy the R journey~
