!Series_summary	"In D. melanogaster males, X chromosome monosomy is compensated by chromosome-wide transcription activation. We found that complete dosage compensation during embryogenesis takes surprisingly long. Although the activating Dosage Compensation Complex (DCC) associates with the chromosome and acetylates histone H4 early, many genes are not compensated. Acetylation levels on gene bodies continue to increase for several hours after gastrulation in parallel with progressive compensation. Constitutive genes are compensated earlier than developmental genes. Remarkably, later compensation correlates with longer distances to DCC binding sites. This time-space relationship suggests that DCC action on target genes requires maturation of the active chromosome compartment."

Stages were determined by morphological features under stereomicroscope. Embryos were smashed with a needle into 200 µl lysis buffer (Agencourt RNAdvance Tissue kit, Beckman Coulter, Cat. No. A32645) and 10 μl 1:100 ERCC Spike-in RNA mix was added (Ambion, Cat. No. 4456740). RNA was extracted from the lysate following the manufacturers protocol with volume adjustment."
