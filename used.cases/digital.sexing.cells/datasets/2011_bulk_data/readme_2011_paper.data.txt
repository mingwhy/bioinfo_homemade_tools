dataset S1.

Reads from each RNA-Seq sample were mapped to the reference D. melanogaster genome (FlyBase release 5.27 [54,55]) using Bowtie [18] and TopHat [19], and transcript abundances for annotated RNAs were called by Cufflinks [20].

We sequenced mRNA from 24 single D. melanogaster embryos (12 male and 12 female) taken from 8 early embryonic timepoints to generate the first sex specific timecourse of gene expression in early Drosophila development
	
24 samples in total.
